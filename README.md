# Royal TSX V2 Public Source Code

### Requirements for building Connection Plugins
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* Command Line Tools for Xcode
* [64-bit Mono Framework](http://monobjc.net/downloads-archives-mono.html)
* [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio)
* [Monobjc](http://monobjc.net/downloads.html)

It's recommended to install the required software in this order. The important part is that Xamarin Studio and Monobjc must be installed after the Mono Framework.

### How to build the sample Connection Plugin
* Open RoyalTSX_V2_Public.sln with Xamarin Studio.
* Build the DummyConnection project.

### How to use the Plugin in Royal TSX
* Restart Royal TSX to reload all Plugins.
* Go to Preferences - Plugin Settings - Remote Desktop and switch the 'Default Plugin' to 'Dummy'.
* Initiate a Remote Desktop Connection.
